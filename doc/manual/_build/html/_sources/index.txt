Welcome to Terminator's documentation!
======================================

This is the beginnings of a manual for Terminator. Sometimes it is not always
clear just how many little shortcuts and features there are in Terminator. This
guide hopes to reduce the confusion.

entitled to a refund of the money you paid to me to write this... ðŸ˜Ž

   In case it's not obvious this is faked up. I use more complex setups,
   but I'm not putting real work into the documentation.
