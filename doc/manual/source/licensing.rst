Licensing
=========

The Terminator **Application** is written and distributed under the
terms of the `GNU GPL v2 licence`_. Please note that it is not v2+.

For specifics of any included **Plugins** please see the :ref:`plugins`
page.

The **ConfigObj** library was sourced from `voidspace.org.uk`_, and
is licensed under the `BSD 3-Clause licence`_, as stated `here`_.

**Man pages** and **Misc documents** have no explicitly different
licensing, so it is assumed that they fall under the applications
`GNU GPL v2 licence`_ insofar as it can be said to apply to
non-source code files.

The main **Terminator icon** was created by *Cory Kontros*, and
provided under the `CC-BY-SA licence`_.

This **Manual** and **API documentation** are wholly new pieces
created by the current maintainer *Steve Boddy*, and are distributed
under the `CC-BY-SA licence`_, as are the horrific attempts by yours
truly at using Cory's icon to provide page identities.

The **Documentation Theme**  is the `Read The Docs`_ theme by *Dave
Snider*, which is distributed under the `MIT licence`_. The theme is
available on `GitHub`_.
